    <h2>About UNSDG 6</h2>
    <p>1. UNSDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation
        Goal Description:
        UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. This includes equitable access to safe drinking water, effective wastewater treatment, and the promotion of hygiene education globally.
        
        Key Targets of UNSDG 6:
        
        Access to Safe Water: Universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.
        Sanitation and Hygiene: Access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene, ending open defecation.
        Improved Water Quality: Reducing pollution, minimizing hazardous chemicals, and halving untreated wastewater.
        Water Use Efficiency: Sustainable management of water resources to address scarcity.
        Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM): Strengthening local and transboundary water cooperation.
        Protect and Restore Ecosystems: Safeguarding water-related ecosystems such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands.
        Why it Matters:
        
        Nearly 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water.
        Unsafe water and poor sanitation result in over 1.2 million deaths annually from waterborne diseases like diarrhea.
        Water scarcity affects 40% of the world’s population and is projected to rise due to climate change and overextraction.
        AquaMed's Contribution:
        
        Leveraging pharmaceutical production practices to reduce water consumption.
        Implementing technologies to recycle and treat wastewater.
        Partnering with NGOs and governments to improve sanitation infrastructure in rural communities.

    <h2>Our Initiatives</h2>
    <p>2. Wastewater Recycling
        Definition:
        Wastewater recycling is the process of treating and reusing water from residential, industrial, or agricultural sources. Treated wastewater can be repurposed for agricultural irrigation, industrial processes, and even drinking water in advanced systems.
        
        Benefits of Wastewater Recycling:
        
        Conservation of Freshwater: Reduces dependence on natural freshwater resources, addressing water scarcity.
        Environmental Protection: Prevents untreated wastewater from contaminating rivers, lakes, and oceans.
        Cost Efficiency: Reduces the costs of sourcing and treating new water supplies, especially in industries like pharmaceuticals.
        Support for Agriculture: Provides a reliable water source for irrigation in arid regions.
        Circular Economy: Promotes a sustainable water management model by reusing resources.
        Technologies Used in Wastewater Recycling:
        
        Membrane Filtration: Removes impurities and contaminants using ultra-thin membranes.
        Biological Treatment: Employs bacteria and microorganisms to break down organic matter.
        Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP): Uses chemical treatments to remove pollutants.
        Desalination: Converts saline wastewater into fresh water, particularly in coastal areas.
        AquaMed's Role:
        
        Using advanced wastewater treatment plants to recycle over 70% of the water used in manufacturing.
        Partnering with local municipalities to share best practices and technology for effective wastewater management.
        Educating employees and partners on water-efficient practices.
        3. Hygiene Education
        What is Hygiene Education? Hygiene education involves teaching individuals and communities the importance of personal hygiene practices, including handwashing, menstrual hygiene management, and sanitation. It aims to prevent diseases, reduce healthcare costs, and improve quality of life.
        
        Key Areas of Focus:
        
        Hand Hygiene: Proper handwashing with soap to reduce the spread of diseases like diarrhea and respiratory infections.
        Menstrual Hygiene Management: Educating women and girls about safe menstrual practices and ensuring access to sanitary products.
        Sanitation: Promoting the use of toilets and eliminating open defecation.
        School Hygiene Programs: Incorporating hygiene education in school curriculums to instill habits from a young age.
        Why Hygiene Education is Crucial:
        
        Poor hygiene is a leading cause of waterborne diseases, accounting for over 3.5 million preventable deaths annually.
        Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhea cases by up to 30–50%.
        Ensuring menstrual hygiene helps reduce school absenteeism among girls in rural areas.
        How AquaMed Contributes:
        
        Partnering with NGOs to distribute free hygiene kits (soap, sanitizers, menstrual products) in underserved communities.
        Conducting hygiene awareness drives in schools and rural areas, teaching children the basics of hygiene.
        Creating digital resources and workshops to spread hygiene best practices.
        Leveraging AquaMed’s pharmaceutical expertise to produce low-cost, eco-friendly hygiene products.
        How These Tie Together for AquaMed
        UNSDG 6: Acts as the overarching framework, emphasizing clean water and sanitation for all.
        Wastewater Recycling: Ensures sustainable industrial water usage, minimizing environmental impact and addressing water scarcity.
        Hygiene Education: Directly supports community health by reducing diseases caused by poor sanitation and hygiene.
